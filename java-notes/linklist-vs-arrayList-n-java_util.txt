linkedList -vs- arrayList in java.util

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3QbptJRln4


there are 4 array list in the java.util: LinkedList, ArrayList, Vector, Stack.
(vector is the least most used because its used only in multi-threaded applications)

the two most that you will use are LinkedList and ArrayList.

ArrayList you will have to pre guess and set the slot space of the arrays.

LinkedList you do not have to preset the space it will auto point to the next ending index of the added list.
(now searching in LinkedList is slower but uses up less memory)


You call these two by importing the java.util.ArrayList; and the java.util.List;
