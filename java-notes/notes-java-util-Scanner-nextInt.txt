import java.util.Scanner;


use the build in Scanner util in java to create memory space to allow a user to type
there information in the field.



1) import java.util.Scanner; //so place this at the top outside your class.
2)  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); // define this inside of your class
3)  int attackPoints = sc.nextInt(); // sc.nextInt to allow the user to type a number in the field and then auto skip to the next line in the function.

full example below:

----------------------------------
package com.company;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Fighting{

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	 Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	 System.out.println("Attack Fighting Points!");
	 int attackPoints = sc.nextInt();
	 System.out.println("Yo Azz is getting cracked!");
	 int blockPoints = sc.nextInt();
	 System.out.println("Protect yo self!!!");

	    if( attackPoints >= 100 ){
            System.out.println("Dude your being attack by 100pts are more. You are losing bro! ");
        }else{
            System.out.println("Way to keep yo head down to stay UNDER 99pts playa from being attacked. Good blocking points:" + blockPoints);
        }

    }
}
