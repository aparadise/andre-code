Final, Void, Public, return.


1. "Final" key word is like "Const" in javascript. It can not be changed.
Example:

 Final String a = "1"; //since its Final the variable can never be overwritten.
 Final Sting B;
 B = "2"  // this is now Final B will always be '2'
 B = "3" // variable B will now be and error because it cant be overwritten once its set.




2. "Void" keyword means that you can NEVER have 'return' key word inside of its method. 
    Voind only hold the answer and you will need to invoke the function class name to work.
example:
B obj = new B()
obj.show()



3. in order to call another class from another class the class from  newB() its class must be set to "public"
