es6 'const' key word variable can not be reassigned once declared but it can be updated by using .push[]

note: let and const are 'muteable' meaning they both can change over time.

<script>
const foo = 1;
console.log(foo);

//example 1
function go1() {
  const foo = 2; //global block level allowing foo NOT to be over copy the foo=1
  console.log(foo);
}
go1();


//example 2
function go2() {
  if(true){
  const tmp = 33;
  }
  console.log(tmp); //you will get error cuz of block scope
}
go2();
</script>
