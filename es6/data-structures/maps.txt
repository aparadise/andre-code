maps are data structures that store key value pairs.
javascritpt in arrays are objects that are maps that store key value pairs.


objects are simular to maps. they let you set keys to values, retrieve keys, delete keys, and tells you if you have something stored in a key.

the difference between objects and ES6 maps are: and object has a protoype so there are defualt keys in a map that can collide with
your keys in a map if your not careful. The keys of and object CAN ONLY BE keys are symbols. But keys to a map CAN BE ANYTHING... string, numbers, boolean or functions.

You can get the size of a map with the size property.

So you want to use a mpap if  you have a collection.

Example ES6: 

var theMap = new Map();
theMap.has('andre'); //returns 'false' because i have not put ANYTHING in the map yet
theMap.entries(); //this returns ALL of the keys in the map.
let keyObj ={};
let keyFunc = function(){};

theMap.set(keyObj,'i am empty object'); //enter key and value
theMap.set(keyFunc,'i am just a function(){}'); //enter key and value
theMap.set('hello','world'); //enter key and value
theMap.set('hello2','world2'); //enter key and value
theMap.set('hello3','world3'); //enter key and value

console.log(theMap.size); // returns full count of the ALL of the keys/values
console.log(theMap.get('hello2')); //enter the key and it returns the value
