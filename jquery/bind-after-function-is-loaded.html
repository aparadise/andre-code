Jquery to make the function keep firing after its been loaded YOU MUST add the hook between the 'click' and function.

New content added after your code hooking up the event runs WiLL NOT
 re-run. So you need add the hook. 
You can use delegated handling instead telling the click to listen/look for exactly where the event is in this example
'a.delete' :


<script>

    $(document).ready(function(){
        $('#parent').on('click', 'a.delete', function(){
            //code
        }):
    });

</script>
