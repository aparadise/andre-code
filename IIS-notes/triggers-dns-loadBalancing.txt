triggers****
create trigger is the function call.
they are created after statement is ran on the query like for example insert.
once the insert has been updated the you can trigger something simple like print statment.

but a practical way is to use 'raiseError' message that shows the msg the severity level and the access leve.

(note tiggers can be used on inserts and after)

**load balancing**
using more than a single server with a piece of hardware knowns as the load balancer (you can combine componetes).
a well balanced load balance server be used for billions of hits.
and the server clones and monitor A to B. so if one server goes down the other server pics up and 
no ones knows.

a system can have load balancer and still not be highly available. It can be scaleable but it still might not work.
so you fix it by using a redudnent load balancer

DNS server****
IP address and hostname and port and type.
type= https
IP = http://333.999
host= www.wwt.com
port: 80
