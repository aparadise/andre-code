angular 6 notes:
------------

* DataServices is for contecting to database to pass data for a private dependency Injections for HttpClient.
  (dependency injections also means its being injected through as an arrgument) 


* routers is for URL routes from home, :id paramerters

* rxjs = will return the {Observable} data and hold it from the api until its called to be used. (look up the course rxjs)
and you call the rxjs intp your app.module.ts AFTER you have set up your Services code and updated your @NgModule.

(google and learn angular life cycle hooks)

* remember 'ngOnInit' means that the function will load as soon as the page loads.
ngOnInit is a function that brings in the function from the Services HttpClient
