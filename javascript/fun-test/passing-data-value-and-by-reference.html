javascript passes data by 'reference' vs 'value'
passing data by value = is primative data type such as 'number' or 'string' without properties are being passed.
(means you are always updating the variable with the value of the data)

passing data by reference =  is passing array or object


<script>
const list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const list2 = list1; 
list1.push(6, 7, 8); //this is value of numbers of primative data type.

console.log(list2); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (because the data is getting updated by value)


/* if you didnt want 'list2' to value to be updated by the 'list1.push' you can keep the 
orginal value of 'list1' in 'list2' by using the '.slice()' or '.concat([])' this will preserve the orignal value.

example: 

const list2 = list1.slice();
// const list2 = list1.concat([]);
console.log('List 1: ', list1);
console.log('List 2: ', list2);

*/

</script>
