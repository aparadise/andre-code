Object Properties, property strings.
'[object Object]'

NOTE: Objects can ONLY be passed as 'strings'

so there for if i pass and Object as a VALUE... the it will be seen as a 'string'  for '[object Object]' as the new property name and 
but the VALUE itself will be the same.

so below in my code the property 'name' will be changed to and entire '[object Object]' when being passed and keeping its value.

so '[object Object]' : VALUE

<script>
    const a = {};
    const b = { name: 'b' };
    const c = { name: 'c' };
    
    a[b] = 200;
    // a['[object Object]'] = 200
    
//notice const 'a' is passed under the hood or behind the scenes as '[object Object]' not by property 'name' but as entire object.

    a[c] = 400;
    // a['[object Object]'] = 400
    
    console.log(a[b]); //400 because of the stacking order i am passing the same string '[object Object]' each time.
    // console.log(a['[object Object]']);

</script>
