In javascript for..in works this way:

for (var key in objectOrArray) {
    console.log(key, objectOrArray[key]);
}

The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for each property.

Looping through the properties of an object:

Example

var person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25}; 

for (x in person) {
    txt += person[x];
}

--notes----

secondly for(x in person) here x is the key hence person[x] will give the value.

now in line txt = txt + person[x] you are just concatenating strings (values and not keys), so  txt will just contain all the values

First, there is no concept of associate arrays in JavaScript, the person is an object and an object is iterated using the for-in loop.

The line:

txt = txt + person[x];
simply reads each property of the person objects and concatenates the value in the txt variable giving the result:

JohnDoe25
