Jquery to make the function keep firing after its been loaded YOU MUST add the hook between the 'click' and function.

Call and Apply is used the EXACT same way. the only difference is 
apply() take arrays for the arguments after the binded function has been declared.

<script>

const car1 = {
  brand: 'Porsche',
  getCarDescription: function(cost, year, color) {
    console.log(`This car is a ${this.brand}. The price is $${cost}. The year is ${year}. The color is ${color}.\n`);
  }
};
 
const car2 = {
  brand: 'Lamborghini'
};
 
const car3 = {
  brand: 'Ford'
};
 
car1.getCarDescription(80000, 2010, 'blue'); //basic method to call the arguments
car1.getCarDescription.call(car2, 200000, 2013, 'yellow'); //call() to first bind car2 to car1 as a shared property THEN call the arguments.
car1.getCarDescription.apply(car3, [35000, 2012, 'black']); //apply() to first bind car3 to car1 as a shared property THEN call the arguments inside of the array[].

</script>
