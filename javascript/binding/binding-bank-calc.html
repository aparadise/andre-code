<script>
    const account1 = {
    name: 'bob',
    totalAmount: 5000,
    deductAmount: function(amount) {
        this.totalAmount -= amount;

    const account2 = {
    name: 'andre',
    totalAmount: 8000,
    };
    
    const withdrawFromAccount = function(amount) {
    //.bind() binds the first argument 'account2' object to ALL of the propeties & methods to 'account1'. NOW the 'amount' is just arguments for passing the number to the console.log. 
    //there for becoming a prototype
    return account1.deductAmount.bind(account2, amount);
    };
    
    console.log(withdrawFromAccount(500)()); //7500
    console.log(withdrawFromAccount(200)()); //7300
